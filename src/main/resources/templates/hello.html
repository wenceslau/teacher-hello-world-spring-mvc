            Thymeleaf is a template engine that allows us to create dynamic content in our views.
            The views are processed on the server side and the final result is sent to the client.

            Here I am using the th:text attribute to display the message that was passed from the controller
            on the Model object.

        <span th:text="${mensagem}"></span>!
